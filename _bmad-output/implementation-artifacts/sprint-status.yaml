# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

  # Vest Adapter Enhancements (2026-02-01):
  # - place_order() with EIP-712 signing (personal_sign)
  # - set_leverage() / get_leverage() - leverage management
  # - get_positions() / get_account_info() - position tracking
  # - pre_sign_order() + send_presigned_order() - latency optimization (~0.16ms signing in release)
  # - Round-trip tested: BUY + SELL with reduce_only=true, leverage 5x confirmed
  # - Market orders (taker) only - no need for cancel_order (Story 4.6 simplified)
  #
  # Paradex Adapter Enhancements (2026-02-01):
  # - place_order() with SNIP-12 signing (StarkNet typed data)
  # - Dynamic chain_id from /system/config (PRIVATE_SN_PARACLEAR_MAINNET)
  # - JWT auth with proper expiry calculation (ms not s)
  # - Market orders working (taker), LIMIT+IOC supported
  # - Round-trip tested: MARKET BUY + MARKET SELL with reduce_only=true
  # - Latency profiling: ~250ms (99.9% HTTP, crypto negligible)
  
  2-2-placement-ordre-short: done
  # Paradex Short Orders (2026-02-01):
  # - get_position() implemented - fetches /positions endpoint
  # - reduce_only=true tested for closing positions
  # - Full lifecycle: open LONG -> get_position -> close with SELL reduce_only
  # - Position closes successfully verified via final get_position() check
  # - Both Vest and Paradex use REST API (parallel execution via tokio::join!)
